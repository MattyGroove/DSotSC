@3 = ~I do not have the luxury of time to waste. Either we proceed to find this vile creature or I will move on without ye!~
@4 = ~Why do we still delay in the quest at hand? We must move now! I will give ye just one more day. If we have not made earnest progress by then...I will be forced to proceed alone.~
@5 = ~'Tis understandable why I prefer to deal with such matters alone! Very well, do as ye please. I bid ye farewell!~
@6 = ~Well, Lord Daerthmac, it would appear that you are not so indestructible after all. Your days of terror have ended. Friends, I am not one for good-byes , but it is time I move on. Fare thee well - Let us depart Madadh n'Sgŕil.~
@7 = ~Daerthmac, you underestimate me. You and your minion will fall, be it by my hand or anothers, your reign of terror is over. The people of Faerűn will know peace again. Return to me the child Daerthmac. Your end will be quick.~
