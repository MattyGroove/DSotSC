@1 = ~Well met travelers, my name is Keiria Silverstring. Would ye be looking for the company of a bard on your travels. I can hold my own in any fight and sing a song to entertain you when you're sitting about the fire at night. What say ye?~
@2 = ~Well met and welcome. We can always use another hand. And some music would indeed be good!~
@3 = ~I'm sorry, but we have no need for another hand right now.~
@4 = ~You can? Many thanks to ye. I was getting so very tired of this carnival.~
@5 = ~I understand. Perhaps next time?~
@6 = ~Hello again. Have you changed your mind?~
@7 = ~Yes, please join.~
