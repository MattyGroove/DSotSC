@1 = ~Well my young friend, it wouldst seem that fate continues to bring us together.~
@2 = ~It would appear so. Though I don't quite understand it all. Isn't there anymore that you can tell me?~
@3 = ~Yes it does. But if you ask me I think it's a bit more than fate old man. I think you are following me around...are you making sure I don't get myself into trouble? Well let me tell you, I can take care of myself just fine!~
@4 = ~You will find the answers to all of your questions in time, young <CHARNAME>. It is not for me to interfere nor guide you in the path that you must take on your own. However, as I say that, I would like to provide one thing for you. You received an expertly crafted weapon from the smith Otho. That weapon is a very important item for you to retain. You will need it's strength in the very near future. If you will allow me this once I would like to place an enchantment on that item to further it's strength and performance. But, after I do this, I suggest that you take this weapon and have a blessing placed upon it. The evil that you are about to face requires a little help from divine intervention. And I believe someone in a most holy position suggested that they would help you when you needed it. Maybe this is the time? But for now...I will perform this task and take my leave of you.~
