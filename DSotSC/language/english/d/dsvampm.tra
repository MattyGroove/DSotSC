@1 = ~So, CúChoinneach,we meet again! Do you really think that you can do anything to stop me? You are nothing more than a pathetic little elf.~
@2 = ~Ha ha ha , you forget CúChoinneach. I am already dead, I am indestructible. You cannot stop me. No one can. Try if you must, you will die trying. And I will enjoy making you one of us, the ultimate victory will be mine. You will become what you despise most. Are you ready Clairis?~
@3 = ~Well, it would appear that we have guests. You should have let us know you where coming and we would have prepared a welcome for you.~
@4 = ~Where is the child Daerthmac? Give him to us now, or...~
@5 = ~Or what! Ha ha ha,do you, mere mortals, think you can stop me? You speak hollow words and know nothing of me or my powers. Stop me if you can. You will die in the attempt. Are you ready Clairis?~
@6 = ~Fools!~
@7 = ~Now you die!~
