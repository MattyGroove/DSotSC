@1 = ~Who dares to disturb me?~
@2 = ~We have come to force you to release your hold on that group of adventurers to the east of here.~
@3 = ~Ha, Ha, Ha...Fools, you shall force nothing.....wait! Ah, but of course...you are the pathetic mortals who just destroyed the latest addition to my pets.....she came to me lost, and I gave here eternity...and now you have taken that from her. Now I shall add you to my collection to take her place! You have no idea of the fate you face!~
@4 = ~You...you were the one who did that to Ferium? Then we have no choice but to destroy you as well.~
@5 = ~It is you who will be destroyed...I am your worst nightmare!~
