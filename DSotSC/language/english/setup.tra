Gothmog was ambushed by a patrol of duergar, who made their way to the surface one moonless night to seek out prey. Skeezer, camping nearby, witnessed the attack and thrust his staff into the ground, causing the sky to become as bright as any midday and sending the duergar running. From that day on, Gothmog and Skeezer became close friends. Gothmog even became interested in his gnomish friend's magical abilities, and in secret tried out a few small spells when making the helm, knowing of course that his clan would frown upon such activities.

Though Skeezer claims the helm is blessed with all the powers of Clangeddin himself, the prominent horns jutting from its sides impress you far more, particularly when one nearly pierces your arm. Thankfully, he seems to don it only when anticipating battle.

A long time ago a wise mage by the name Roach happened upon the young elf CúChoinneach. Roach saw in this young elf the true spirit of adventure and proceeded to ask him to take a long journey. This journey descended into the mysteries that lie hidden in the Swordcoast. Roach knew that there was much more here than met the eye. With Roach's guidance and encouragement, CúChoinneach begin to uncover the many dark stories that still lie hidden beneath the surface of the idealic setting of the Coast Road Way. He spent many a sleepless night trying to cast just the right Hex to reveal yet another mystery. Sometimes he would succeed, much to his surprise. Yet, other times his failure would be miserable and disheartening. He also had to deal with the fact that many said the Dark Side didn't exists, or if it does, it's better left to a more seasoned adventurer. But, CúChoinneach paid them no mind and continued the search.

During his journey, CúChoinneach met a range of unique individuals that, in thier own way, had contributed to Roach and CúChoinneach's discoveries. Among these colorful denizens of the Sword Coast was a man known simply as Ken the Baker, though he is not a Baker, no one really knows how he got that name. He is often found in the Jovial Juggler in Beregost, usually right after a big victory by Team Baldur's Gate. Ken, as some call him, too believed that many mysteries lie hidden in the Sword Coast and started his team of "Hexers" to begin research of these mysteries. Among these hexers were enchanters, illustionist, and representatives from just about every school.

One of these individuals went simply by the name of Banelord. He was able to show CúChoinneach some of the finer points of Hexing, but a short time after that Banelord faded from the scene. Rumours abound as to the reason for his quick departure, but nothing has ever been confirmed.

The list continues to grow as the journey continues...

However, being the youngest, he had little hope of inheriting much of the family's holdings, so he set out to make a life for himself when he reached the age of twenty. He started his training as a paladin and spent a few years living the virtuous life of the paladin. However, he eventually felt too restricted with the discipline and wished from something with more glory. On one of his treks from Waterdeep to Baldur's Gate, he met a warrior by the name of Fergus Ravenskill. Fergus was a very valiant warrior and had spent most of his fifty-six years on the battlefield. Conchobhair had spent a few months on the road with Ravenskill, whose tales of great battles intrigued the young paladin. However, it was not until Fergus spoke of his encounter with a blue dragon that Conchobhair decided to make a life change. He asked Fergus to train
and teach him everything that he knew. Conchobhair spent six years training with Fergus in the ways of a seasoned warrior and even took positions as a mercenary for a few of the larger cities in the area. However, one fateful day brought Fergus and Conchobhair face to face with a red dragon. This was a dragon Fergus had encountered some twenty years prior, at which time Fergus had injured it by blinding it in one eye. The dragon was bent on seeking his revenge and the opportunity presented itself. Fergus died in the attack, from multiple burns caused by the blazing breath weapon, and Conchobhair escaped with minor burns and wounds. It was on this day that he vowed to destroy any dragon that presented a threat to Realms, and to find the dragon that killed his friend and mentor.~

His father, Breachin Trollslayer, had been a wandering ironsmith who plied his trade in the numerous small villages which dot the Sword Coast. However, Breachin met an unfortunate end defending his son from a patrol of verbeegs in the Cloudpeak Mountains, and young Ferthgil (only in his teens) wandered, helpless and lonely for days carrying only his father's axe. It was at this time that he was found by a certain Gulmoth Stonehearth, an alaghor (priest) of Clangeddin Silverbeard. Gulmoth saw all the rage and frustration in Ferthgil, but also saw the potential nobility the young lad had. Gulmoth trained the lad at Stonehearth Keep, a haven for dwarves in the southern Sword Coast, and here Ferthgil learned to channel his rage in the service of the god of war. However, Ferthgil had inherited from his father a desire to see the world, and could not stay long in one place, so one morning
Ferthgil left the haven and seclusion of Stonehearth Keep and went on his way. Ferthgil was clanless, homeless, and more importantly penniless, but on the way to Velen in the south, he met with someone who was to become his life long companion, Tearlac Truehammer, of Clan Truehammer in the north. Tearlac and Ferthgil became firm friends, and before long, Ferthgil began to feel he belonged somewhere. Although not officially, he was considered as part of the Truehammer clan. Ferthgil will on first meeting look average enough, and indeed will strike you as a particularly cantankerous dwarf, but through his training from Gulmoth, he has learned to channel his rage against the enemies of Clangeddin. For those who have never seen this, the change is startling. Ferthgil becomes a mighty adversary, and his battle cries have been known to reach the ears of Clangeddin himself all the way to his fortress in Arcadia.~

Upon his journey, he met and had his life saved a few times by Jet'laya's future father, Torvin. After traveling together for some time and becoming close friends, her father and "uncle" returned to Cormanthor. Once in the city, Lennan (Le'non) introduced Torvin to Lennan's father, a wealthy and powerful noble. Being quite impressed with Torvin and thankful for his saving his son's life, Lennan's father fought to get Torvin accepted into the city. He won. Torvin quickly became liked by most, and fell in love with Jet'laya's mother, who was one of Cormanthor's healers. Several members in society looked down on their marriage, forcing them to live near the edge of the forest. When Jet'laya and her twin brother were six, Cormanthor was attacked by a group of undead led by a young, brash vampire. Jet'laya, her brother and older sister were hidden in
safety while the elves defended the city. The elves killed the entire group of attackers except for their leader. The vampire managed to escape and has not been heard from since. However, the elves incurred several casualties, including Jet'laya's parents. Her older sister was wounded and was never able to recover fully from the attack. She suffered for many years. Seeing her parents killed was a constant source of nightmares for Jet'laya, and she vowed revenge for her parents' death upon all undead. Despite the best efforts of her uncle and her twin, who seemed less affected by his parents' death, Jet'laya could not be swayed from her path. She left as soon as her training, as she called it, was complete.~

He feels this could result in the ultimate tinker creation, though he has yet to achieve this. He has shied away from the normal way of the tinker gnome in search of a greater understanding of magic. His creations so far have resulted in limited success. One of his earliest creations he created when he was a boy was one named "The Automatic (Systematic) Articulated Mop and Spring-Loaded Broom-Driven Pie Tin Flier and Egg Dropper" (or ASAMSLBDPTFED for short). It would send eggs flying at very high speeds, but had no real purpose. One of Skeezer's greatest desires in all of Faerűn is to see the beautiful skyships.

His greatest wish was to have exciting adventures like the ones he's read about in books and heard from adventurers passing through his village. The inhabitants of Gullykin always found him daydreaming instead of doing his regular duties. To him, adventuring was everything. One day, his village was beset with a flurry of activity as the villagers had learned of a forest dragon that was on the move toward Gullykin. Gandolar Luckyfoot organized a group to battle the dragon before it could get much closer to the village. Bardo eagerly joined the effort, anxious to see some adventure finally.~

@20645 = ~When asked about his past, BUB SNIKT relates he was born in Daggerford, a village situated on the Trade Way between Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. The seventh son of a farmer, Bub grew up on the farm and became his father's favorite son. In his youth, his father taught him the ways of rural life, and his brothers helped him with hunting skills. It wasn't long before they noticed Bub had a keen eye, and his skill with the bow became as good as any archer of the castle guard. Each year, life on the farm carried on as usual. Occasionally, he would find himself with his brothers and the local militia defending Daggerford's farmsteads against marauding lizardfolk from the Lizard Marsh, but most of the time life on the farm went unchanged. It was a few days after one particular Highharvesttide that things started to change. Bub had made his regular visit to Daggerford to sell produce at the local market, when the call to arms was made. A group of ogres had sneaked through the Misty Forest from the High
Moor and were attacking the local farmsteads, killing farmers and stealing whatever food they could carry. Concerned for his family's safety, Bub left the wagon and rode at a gallop straight out of Farmer's Gate with three miles ahead of him. By the time he'd reached the farm, his brothers were already heavy into fighting several large ogres, the sheer size of which sent fear coursing through Bub's body. It was at that time that he remembered the talisman his father had given him as a child. The symbol of Tempus hung around his neck. Bub can't remember what happened that day, but when he joined his brothers in battle, it was as if he'd been blessed with the speed and strength of ten men. No ogre stood in his way. His arrows were true to the mark and each swing of his blade offered no resistance. Within the space of an hour, all of the ogres were dead, and his brothers could only look upon him with awe. Soon after the encounter, Bub's attitude changed. He became less interested in rural life and decided to
take up a profession as a hired adventurer. He traveled first to Baldur's Gate then to the town of Beregost where he plies his trade as a swordsman protecting the local farmsteads from ogres and any other unwanted guests.~

@21050 = ~When asked about his past, THORFINN HAUSKLUNIFF explains that his childhood got off to a bad start. Born on the island of Ruathym, he was offered as a sacrifice to Auriel. The priests of Auriel placed Thorfinn on a raft when he was just a babe, and launched him into the Trackless Sea. At that time, the weather was calm, but strong currents carried the raft south toward the west side of the Moonshae Isles. He drifted for several days until the raft reached the shores of the isle of Moray. Washed up on a pebble beach, Thorfinn was rescued by fishermen and raised in the presence of Northlanders. In his early years, he worked the boat with his adopted family, learning all there was to know about the sea. He became interested in the navy and when he turned sixteen, his request to join was granted by his family. During his late teens, he honed his seafaring skills and began learning the art of swordplay. He became adept with the axe, but his strength gave him the ability to swing a large sword with ease, an ability not lost on the marauding pirates and thieves of the Moonshaes. The two-handed sword became his weapon of choice. After five years, Thorfinn decided to leave the navy and travel. He worked as a mercenary and sword-for-hire protecting merchants as they traveled the caravan routes. Eventually, Thorfinn's travels brought him to the Sword Coast and into the city of Baldur's Gate.~
