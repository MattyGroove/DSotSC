Currently only English and Spanish version is available. This is due to the major balancing changes in items and spells, so strings had to be updated. Also mod now supports EET (mod similar to BGT but for Enhanced Edition games), so items also need additional version of item descriptions that follows Beamdog formatting. If you want to update the translation please open "DSotSC/docs/tra_changes_v3.html", take a look how English setup.tra strings differ and send me (K4thos) updated files on SHS or upload them yourself on GitHub: https://github.com/K4thos/DSotSC

Strings from soundsets.tra and files within ogg directory (the one in language dir) are exported directly from Icewind Dale 2, so no need to translate them. I will export them myself if you send me "Sounds" folder (if Icewind Dale 2 version released in your country has been dubbed) and dialog.tlk file (if Icewind Dale 2 version released in your country has translated text).
